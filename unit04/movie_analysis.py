    # 1. Create a new list called avg_ratings that has each movie's average rating 



    # 2. Print out each movie and its average rating in nice aligned columns (use f-strings)
    # Ex. Movie             Rating
    #     Inception         9.10
    #     Finding Nemo      8.90




    # 3. Use python to determine: Which movie has the highest average rating? Print it out. 



    # 4. Which movie is mid? Use python to find the movie whose average rating is approx the middle of the pack and print it out. 



    # 5. Ask the user for a movie and then tell them the highest and lowest rating that critics gave that movie. 
    # This shouldn't crash if the entered movie isn't in the list; instead it should ask the user again until they enter a movie that is in the list
